# Hatch Fee Explanation

## Hatchâ€™s exchange fee is 50 bps or 50 pips.
If the interbank exchange rate was `NZ\$1 = US\$0.7000`, an investor would receive `US$0.692` for every dollar they invested. A walkthrough of Hatch fees explains this in detail:
1. Investor A wants to buy **NZD 1,000** in Walmart shares, priced at USD 100 each. Investor A transfers their NZD to their Hatch account when the interbank NZD:USD exchange rate is 0.70. The investor receives `0.695 USD` per NZD (deducting the 50 pips/bps) and receives **USD 695.00**.  
2. Investor A then puts an order in for Walmart shares with the available balance. The brokerage fee of **USD 8** is charged for the purchase, and Investor A receives 6.8700 Walmart shares (valued at **USD 687.00**).
3. When Investor A wants to sell the shares they will pay another **USD 8** for brokerage. The USD value will then sit in Investor A's Hatch balance.
4. If and when Investor A wants to convert the USD balance back into NZD (as opposed to re-investing it), there is a fee to do this. If the interbank NZD:USD exchange rate is again 0.70, the investor will have the balance transferred at a rate of `0.705` (adding 50 pips/bps). For a parcel of shares valued at USD 700 this would calculate to be a **NZD 8 fee**).
5. Hatch investors ultimately benefit from economies of scale - the higher the value of an individual share purchase, the lower the brokerage fees are proportionately on the share parcel.
